==============================

Email Request (!! GMX email address shall not become globally visible !!)
-------------

Hi <>,

<> is implemented now and YAT <x.y.z> is about to be released << soon | within a month or two | ... >>.

If you'd like a preliminary version, let me know you true email address (either via the SourceForge mail feature or by sending an email to << y-a-terminal@users.sourceforge.net | GMX >>) and I will provide you with YAT preliminary binaries via dropbox.

Note that you can sign up for the YAT release notification at https://sourceforge.net/p/y-a-terminal/mailman/. No spam, just an email per release.

Best regards,
Matthias


Dropbox Access
--------------

Hi <>,

I have just given you access to the YAT preliminary binaries at dropbox. Either, extract the binaries to a temporary location, or replace the files in "C:\Program Files\YAT".

Let me know <whatever>.

Best regards,
Matthias
