1. Open OpenOffice Calc or Microsoft Excel
2. Fill in the following values and formula:
    A1: 0
    B1: =SIN((A1/360)*2*PI())
    C1: =RUNDEN(B1*360; 2)
    D1: =RUNDEN(B1*360; 2)
    E1: =WENN(D1>=0; 100; -100)
    F1: =ZEICHEN(65+(ABS(D1)/15))
    G1: =VERKETTEN("A"; F1; "Z")
3. Extend:
    A2: =A1+1
    B1:G1 copy and paste to B2:G2
3. Complete short series by selecting A2:G2 and drag down to row 361
4. Complete long series by selecting A361:E361 and then...
    ...Calc: [Ctrl+Shift+End], [Ctrl+D]
    ...Excel: [Ctrl+C], [Ctrl+Shift+ArrowDown], [Ctrl+V]
5. Export short series by selecting then copy-pasting to a text editor
    Save C1 through C361 to Plot-1-Double.txt
    Save D1 through D361 to Plot-2-Integer.txt
    Save G1 through G361 to Plot-3-String.txt
    Save C1:G1 through C361:G361 to Plot-4-Combined.txt
6. Export short series by selecting then copy-pasting to a text editor
    Save row C to Plot-5-EnormousDouble.txt
    Save rows D:E to Plot-6-EnormousIntegers.txt
   (or copy D:E into new sheet and then export as tab separated .txt)
