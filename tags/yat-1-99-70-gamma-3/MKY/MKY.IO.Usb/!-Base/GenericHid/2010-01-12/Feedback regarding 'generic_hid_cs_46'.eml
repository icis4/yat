Hi Jan,

I have created a 'MKY.IO.Usb' library merging ideas from your 
'generic_hid' and two other libraries for a SourceForge hosted project 
where I needed a USB HID based serial communcation implementation. The 
project is called 'YAT- Yet Another Terminal' and features a terminal to 
operate and debug serial communications. 'YAT' supports 
RS-232/422/423/485 as well as TCP-Client/Server/AutoSocket and UDP. 
Currently I am adding support for USB Ser/HID. You can find 'YAT' on 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/y-a-terminal/.

In the meantime 'MKY.IO.Usb' partly works and I wanted to give you some 
feedback regarding 'generic_hid_cs_46' that I have collected while 
working on 'MKY.IO.Usb':

Overall
- Debuggung/DeviceMgmt/FileIO/Hid should be static classes
 > They contain no state
 > They directly related to the static Win32 API
- API function descriptions should be placed to function declarations 
instead of function calls
- 'using' statements in a file should all be placed together, not 
separated by the file header
- 'internal' should only be used where really needed

Hid.cs
- DisplayException must not be part of the library. Instead, an Error 
event might be useful
 > A library must not directly affect the user interface

Reports
- Abstract base classes should be interfaces
- Report classes should be named InputReport.. and OutputReport.. for 
consistency with .NET naming
- Statement "Read is declared as a Sub rather than as a Function because 
asynchronous reads use a
   callback method that can access parameters passed by ByRef but not 
Function return values." is
   not valid for .NET. All methods can be called synchronously AND 
asynchronously.

FrmMain.cs
- FindTheHid() doesn't support handling multiple devices with same vid/pid
- Main parts of the implementation should be placed into a separate 
class called something like 'GenericHidDevice'

Details about the reasons to merge the three libraries and more detailed 
information on 'MKY.IO.Usb' can be found in the YAT SVN repository under 
https://y-a-terminal.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/y-a-terminal/trunk/MKY.IO.Usb/_Doc/MKY.IO.Usb.txt.

I am happy to share thoughts and suggestions.

Best regards,
Matthias
