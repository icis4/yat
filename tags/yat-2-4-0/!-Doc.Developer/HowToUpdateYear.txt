
Takes approx. 20 minutes, given the procedure remains.
Years in this file shall/will be updated along with updating the code.

0.	Makes sure that all files have been committed.

1.	Open Visual Studio (without opening the solution).
	(This step is required because the .vdproj files cannot be edited while the solution is open.)

2.	Search/replace "\Trunk" for the following expressions (match case and whole word) throughout...
	*.vdproj
	...and update year:
	 > "Copyright © 2003-2021 Matthias Kläy." => 4 replacements

3.	Open the solution.

4.	[Build > Batch Build... > Select All > Clean] the solution in order to...
	...speed up search/replace.
	...speed up verification throughout "\Trunk\*.*".

5.	Search/replace solution (includes this file) for the following expressions (match case and whole word) throughout...
	*.*
	...and update year:                 (approx. counts for feasibility check)
	 > "Copyright © 2003-2021 Matthias Kläy."  => ~497 replacements
	 > "Copyright © 2007-2021 Matthias Kläy."  => ~192 replacements
	 > "Copyright © 2010-2021 Matthias Kläy."  =>  ~72 replacements
	 > "Copyright © 2008-2021 Mettler-Toledo." => ~291 replacements (=> scripting, testing)
	 > "Copyright © 2014-2021 Mettler-Toledo." =>   ~6 replacements (=> scripting templates)
	 > "Copyright © 2017-2021 Mettler-Toledo." => ~265 replacements (=> scripting examples, NUnit testing)
	 > " and © 2003-2021 Matthias Kläy."       =>    2 replacements
	 > "2021, Matthias Kläy"                   =>    2 replacements

6.	Then, search "\Trunk" (neither match case and nor whole word) throughout...
	*.*
	...and verify that the following expressions are no more found...
	...except within SVN, 3rd party, archives and other explainable locations:
	 > "2021 " (<= incl. space!), where year = 2021 is the 'old' year
	    > 5 occurrences in "\MKY\MKY.IO.Ports.Test\WorkaroundAnalysis\" expected and to be done manually
	 > "201\d " (<= incl. space!) using RegEx
	 > "202[^2] " (<= incl. space!) using RegEx, where year = 2022 is already the 'new' year

7.	Commit all changes, verifying that SVN properties of all files are up-to-date.

(Note that this procedure "schlägt drei weitere Fliegen auf einen Streich":
 > Detection whether all intended files are included in the solution.
 > Detection whether there are superfluous files in "\Trunk".
 > Detection whether SVN properties of all files are up-to-date.)

8.	Then, search/replace "<OFFLINE>\Releases and Checkpoints\Template" for the following expressions (match case and whole word) throughout...
	*.*
	 > "Copyright © 2003-2021 Matthias Kläy." => 6 replacements

Finally, consider to also check for trailing whitespace according to HowToRemoveTrailingWhitespace.txt.
