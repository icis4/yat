Guys, please send further emails about this to libusb-devel.  Private email
was *maybe* appropriate for the hosting questions, but not this stuff.

Travis Write:
LibUsbDotNet can use libusb-1.0 in two different ways:
 A simpler, but more restrictive higher level interface. (libusb-1.0,
libusb-win32, native WinUSB) Example: LibUsbDotNet - ShowInfo  (also see the
ForceLibUsbWinBack member)
 The lower-level LibUsbDotNet MonoLibUsb api. (libusb-1.0 only - full api
implementation) Example: MonoLibUsb - ShowInfo
Note : libusb-1.0 is progressing very fast.  It now supports libusb-win32 as
well.  In the future, LibUsbDotNet will implement only Libusb-1.0 and WinUSB
support natively; the libusb-1.0 api will be used to support libusb-win32.

 If you find thing something is missing in the library, please let me now so
I can implement it.  FYI, I could not find your libusb.net anywhere in the
YAT repository. (probably a non-issue now)

Travis Write:
I thought it was.. Apologies.. Pass the word! LibUsbDotNet was started in
2006. Its a multi-driver/multi-platform USB Library for .NET

Travis Write:
LibUsbDotNet Release build are always 'Any CPU' .  LibUsbDotNet is pure
(safe) CLR code, the JIT binaries runs as native 32bit/64bit depending on
the platform.  In most cases this is optimal. however, a problem arises when
a 32bit application attempts to use LibUsbDotNet on a 64 bit platform.  This
is why the Win32 configuration exist.  Building the Win32 configuration will
force 32bit allowing LibUsbDotNet to work for a 32bit-only application on a
64 bit platform.

Travis Write:
LibUsbDotNet has a device notifier that works on all platforms (arrival and
removal notifications).  The Linux implementation may not be as solid as
windows; I hope to see this implemented in the ibusb-1.0 api in the future.
(hint.. hint..)

Travis
