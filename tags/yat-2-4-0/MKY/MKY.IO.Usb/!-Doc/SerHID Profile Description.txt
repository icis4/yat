
USB Ser/HID
===========

USB Ser/HID Device is a USB profile that uses a standard HID descriptor to transfer serial data
between a USB Ser/HID Device and a USB Host. Thus, this profile can be used as a replacement for
serial interfaces such as RS-232 or RS-422 or even USB Ser/CDC. The main advantage is the fact
that this profile doesn't need any driver installation if the USB Host is a personal computer.

Pros and Cons of the Ser/HID Device profile
-------------------------------------------
+ Can replace serial COM ports
+ Does not require any driver installation
+ Is very versatile and extendable
- Needs a Ser/HID capable middleware on the PC (e.g. MKY.IO.Usb)
- Needs a Ser/HID implementation on the device (e.g. [4])
- Is not an official USB HID Device profile

The report count (or report length) ideally is equal or smaller than the length of a USB pipe.
The pipe length typically is 8 to 64 bytes, depending on the USB controller that is used.
In the example above, the pipe length is 64 and the report length is limited to 63. A byte is
reserved for future use, it could be used for e.g. serve as a logical channel ID.


Requirements for USB Ser/HID Device developers
----------------------------------------------
Either, implement the 3 pipes that are mandatory for HID devices:
 > Control IN
 > Control OUT
 > Interrupt IN

Or, implement 4 pipes:
 > Control IN
 > Control OUT
 > Interrupt IN
 > Interrupt OUT

MKY.IO.Usb can handle both variants since it uses the Win32 'hid.dll' which itself is capable of
handling both variants. For details about pipes of HID devices see [3], chapter 4.4. For an example
implementation of Ser/HID on a device, see [4].


Constraints by the USB and HID specifications
---------------------------------------------
[2] section 5.7.3 [Interrupt Transfer Packet Size Constraints]
   "support maximum data payload sizes from 0 to 64 bytes for full-speed interrupt endpoints,
    from 0 to 8 bytes for low-speed interrupt endpoints, and from 0 to 1024 bytes for highspeed
    interrupt endpoints"
and
   "The USB does not require that data packets be exactly the maximum size; i.e., if a data packet
    is less than the maximum, it does not need to be padded to the maximum size."

While this is the general USB specification, additional constraints apply to the HID class:

[3] section 5.6 [Reports]
   "but is limited in size to 8 bytes for low-speed devices and 64 bytes for high-speed devices."
and
   "Only Input reports are sent via the Interrupt In pipe. Feature and Output reports must be
    initiated by the host via the Control pipe or an optional Interrupt Out pipe.

[3] section 4.2 [Subclass]
   "a HID class device identifies its data protocol and the type of data provided within its Report
    descriptor"

This statement can be interpreted as only the announced report size is valid. While quiestionably
this interpretation makes sense, since HID reports are expected to have a specific format/content,
so it makes sense to always having to keep the same format.
