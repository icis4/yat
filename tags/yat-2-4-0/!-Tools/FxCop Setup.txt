General
-------

FxCop exists in 2 different versions:
> Stand-alone
> Embedded into Visual Studio as "Code Analysis"

The second option is only available in the more sophisticated (and more expensive) versions of Visual Studio.


Inheritance
-----------

Note that FxCop is not capable to properly inherit settings and suppressions from the parent element, whereas StyleCop is.
Thus, all suppressions must be placed at the very location of the rule violation.


In-Code Suppressions
--------------------

If really needed, suppress rules in-code using the following attribute:
[SuppressMessage(<FxCop :: Message :: Copy As :: SuppressMessage :: Paste>)]

Place FxCop suppressions AFTER StyleCop suppressions, rationale:
> Logical order: Style check should be performed BEFORE
> Dependencies:  StyleCop also checks the suppression statements

Such suppressions only work when CODE_ANALYSIS is defined as a conditional compilation symbol in each project, for all build configurations.
