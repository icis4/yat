
MKY.IO.Serial.Socket
====================

This socket library implements the MKY.IO.Serial.IIOProvider interface for:
 > TCP/IP Client
 > TCP/IP Server
 > TCP/IP AutoSocket
 > UDP/IP Client
 > UDP/IP Server
 > UDP/IP PairSocket


ALAZ
----
Since created in 2007, this implementation is based on ALAZ:
 > "An Asynchronous Socket Server and Client, by Andre Azevedo"
 > http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/14155/An-Asynchronous-Socket-Server-and-Client

Over the years I found a few issues with ALAZ. These issues required to make minor modifications
to ALAZ. These modifications are described below in more detail. I also fed back the issues to
Andre by email. But my feedback was never responded, so I asked online whether any updates or
improvementes of ALAZ can be expected in the future:
 "The purpose of this library is show how Sockets can be development on .NET; it cannot be called
  a "project" with upgrades/new versions. Maybe I'll write some update using .NET 4.5 but, till
  there, you can check SuperSocket Library hosted on codeplex."
After all, 6 releases (1.0 through 1.5) were published between May 2006 and September 2007. So in
2007 this indeed looked like an active project. And in 2009 version 2.0 was released. But then,
well, yet another open-source-dead-end...

See "\ALAZ\!-Packages\2009-04-29 - Version 2.0" for more details.


Alternatives to ALAZ
--------------------
So, in 2012, I again came to the conclusion that sooner or later I will have to exchange ALAZ by
some other library and I also looked into SuperSocket as Andre suggested. But the libraries have
not really proven good enough or suitable for YAT, better than ALAZ, or doesn't seem to be active
anymore either:
 > DotnetAsyncSocket, a "TCP/IP socket networking library for .NET"
   > http://code.google.com/p/dotnetasyncsocket/
   > Looks fairly handish, and not like an active project
 > Extasys, an "Asynchronous TCP/UDP socket library"
   > http://code.google.com/p/extasys/
   > Looks more mature, but the API does not provide DataSent events, and the project doesn't seem
     active as well, well, not really a good option either...
 > SocketAsyncServerAndClient, "C# SocketAsyncEventArgs High Performance Socket Code"
   > http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/83102/C-SocketAsyncEventArgs-High-Performance-Socket-Cod
   > Looks quite mature and powerful, but architecture as well as implementation doesn't look
     that convincing, looks somewhat half-finished...
 > SuperSocket, "an extensible socket application framework"
   > http://supersocket.codeplex.com/
   > In order to reduce dependencies and assemblies, I have decided to remove 'log4net' from all
     used SuperSocket projects. Only few changes were necessary to 'SuperSocket.Common':
      > Remove reference to 'log4net'
      > Remove 'DynamicLog4NetLogger'
      > Remove 'Log4NetLogger'
      > In 'SuperSocket.Common.LogUtil.cs'
         > Comment-out line #5 //using log4net.Config;
         > Modify line #11 m_logger = null;
         > Block-comment-out the three static Setup() methods from line #13
      > In 'SuperSocket.SocketEngine.AppServerBase.cs'
         > Use 'ConsoleLogger' in any case from line #208
   > However, I found that SuperSocket doesn't really suit the needs of YAT. SuperSocket is
     designed to be used for higher level applications, such as custom protocols on TCP/IP.
     YAT doesn't deal with protocols, it just requires a socket library on binary stream level,
     but more convenient then what 'System.Net.Sockets' provides by default.
 > Use of 'System.Net.Sockets' and implement a more convenient library around it on my own. Well,
   not really an option if something useful like ALAZ is already available.
