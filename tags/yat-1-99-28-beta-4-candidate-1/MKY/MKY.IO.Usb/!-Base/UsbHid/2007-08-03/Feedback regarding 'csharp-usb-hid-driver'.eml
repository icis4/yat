Hi Florian,

I have created a 'MKY.IO.Usb' library merging ideas from your 
'csharp-usb-hid-driver' and two other libraries for a SourceForge hosted 
project where I needed a USB HID based serial communcation 
implementation. The project is called 'YAT- Yet Another Terminal' and 
features a terminal to operate and debug serial communications. 'YAT' 
supports RS-232/422/423/485 as well as TCP-Client/Server/AutoSocket and 
UDP. Currently I am adding support for USB Ser/HID. You can find 'YAT' 
on http://sourceforge.net/projects/y-a-terminal/.

In the meantime 'MKY.IO.Usb' partly works and I wanted to give you some 
feedback regarding 'csharp-usb-hid-driver' that I have collected while 
working on 'MKY.IO.Usb':

 > A Windows.Forms example application would be nice in addition to the 
test fixture
 > USBHIDDRIVER and HIDUSBDevice and other identifiers do not comply 
with .NET naming conventions
 > How do you handle multiple devices that have the same VID and PID?

Details about the reasons to merge the three libraries and more detailed 
information on 'MKY.IO.Usb' can be found in the YAT SVN repository under 
https://y-a-terminal.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/y-a-terminal/trunk/MKY.IO.Usb/_Doc/MKY.IO.Usb.txt.

I am happy to share thoughts and suggestions.

Best regards,
Matthias
