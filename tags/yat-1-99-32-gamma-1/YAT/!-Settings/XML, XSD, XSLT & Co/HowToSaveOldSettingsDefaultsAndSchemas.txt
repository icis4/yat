
For YAT 1.99.29 and newer versions, these files can be created using NUnit based 'test' cases in YAT.Settings.Test.SettingsFilesArchiver.

For YAT 1.99.28 and before, code as implemented in YAT.Settings.Test.SettingsFilesArchiver had to be manually added to YAT.Gui.Forms.Main:

1. Open the project of the version to serialize
2. Select the "Debug" configuration
3. Place the code from YAT.Settings.Test.SettingsFilesArchiver into YAT.Gui.Forms.Main
4. Run YAT
   => Files are created in the directory specified

This procedure was done for all versions up to 1.99.28 on 2012-06-16.
