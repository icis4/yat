----------------------

YAT initially used the VS2003..2008 integrated installer functionality (VSI). But VS2013 no longer contained this. Therefore, alternatives were evaluated to pre-releasing YAT 1.99.31 for Raffi Zingg.

InstallShield Limited Edition
 + Prepared by VS2013 as the official replacement of the VSI
 - Registration and download didn't work at first
 - Boasts to contain more features than VSI
 - Doesn't allow to choose 'All Users' !!! => KILLER

InstallAware
 + Congenial ideas and management
 - Too limited in free version => KILLER

WiX
 + Likely to be very powerful
 - Steep learning curve, XML, XML, XML... => NOT REALLY AN OPTION

WiX Edit
 + Looks promising at first
 - Not supporting latest WiX
 - Not supporting file types, fonts,... => KILLER

InstallForge
 + Looks promising at first
 - Not supporting file types, fonts,... => KILLER

VS2008 VSI again
 + Works
 - Maybe not up to date regarding Win8,...
 - Not possible to integrate into YAT.sln => NAJA

Orca
 + Possible to view (and edit) the VS2008 VSI generated .msi
 - Not possible to trick the InstallShield Limited Edition generated .exe

So ?!?

Then, browsing the web once more (to complain at Microsoft regarding the limitations of the InstallShield Limited Edition), finally, finally:
 > "Microsoft Visual Studio Installer Projects"
 > "This official Microsoft extension provides support for Visual Studio Installer Projects in Visual Studio 2013"
 => https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/9abe329c-9bba-44a1-be59-0fbf6151054d
