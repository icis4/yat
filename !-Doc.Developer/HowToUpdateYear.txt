
1.	Open Visual Studio (without opening the solution).

2.	Search "\Trunk" for the following expressions (match case and whole word) throughout...
	*.vdproj
	...and update year:
	 > "Copyright © 2003-2019 Matthias Kläy."  => 4 replacements

(The above step is required because the .vdproj files cannot be edited while the solution is open.)

3.	Open the solution.

4.	Batch clean the solution in order to...
	...speed up search/replace.
	...speed up verification throughout "\Trunk\*.*".

5.	Search solution for the following expressions (match case and whole word) throughout...
	*.*
	...and update year:
	 > "Copyright © 2003-2019 Matthias Kläy."  => 434 replacements
	 > "Copyright © 2007-2019 Matthias Kläy."  => 147 replacements
	 > "Copyright © 2010-2019 Matthias Kläy."  =>  59 replacements
	 > "Copyright © 2008-2018 Mettler-Toledo." => 264 replacements (=> scripting, testing)
	 > "Copyright © 2014-2018 Mettler-Toledo." =>   6 replacements (=> scripting templates)
	 > "Copyright © 2017-2018 Mettler-Toledo." => 183 replacements (=> scripting examples, NUnit testing)
	 > "2019, Matthias Kläy"                   =>   2 replacements

6.	Then, search "\Trunk" (neither match case and nor whole word) throughout...
	*.*
	...and verify that the following expressions are no more found...
	...except within SVN, 3rd party, archives and other explainable locations:
	 > "2018 " (<= incl. space!), where year = 2018 is the 'old' year
	 > "-201[^9] " (<= incl. space!) using RegEx, where year = 2019 is already the 'new' year

7.	Finally, commit all changes, verifying that SVN properties of all files are up-to-date.

(Note that this procedure "schlägt drei weitere Fliegen auf einen Streich":
 > Detection whether all intended files are included in the solution.
 > Detection whether there are superfluous files in "\Trunk".
 > Detection whether SVN properties of all files are up-to-date.)
