
Takes approx. 10 minutes, plus changes in procedure.

1.	Open the solution in Visual Studio.

2.	Batch clean the solution in order to...
	...speed up search/replace.
	...speed up verification throughout "\Trunk".

3.	Search "\Trunk" for "^[^\S\r\n]+(?=\r?$)" (= empty lines but containing whitespace)...
	...throughout *.cs;*.txt;*.bat;*.cmd and manually remove trailing whitespace.

	Removal has to be done manually because...
	...3rd party code must not be changed.
	...*.Designer.cs must not be changed.
	Manual removal is OK since there should only be few findings.

4.	Search "\Trunk" for "[^\S\r\n]+(?=\r?$)" (= non-empty lines containing trailing whitespace)...
	...throughout *.cs;*.txt;*.bat;*.cmd and manually remove trailing whitespace.

	Removal has to be done manually because...
	...3rd party code must not be changed.
	...*.Designer.cs must not be changed.
	..."/// " is contained in documentation blocks.
	Manual removal is a bit cumbersome. It could be replaced by a script that filters the files
	and excludes accepted locations.

5.	Commit all changes, ensuring that 3rd party code remains untouched.
