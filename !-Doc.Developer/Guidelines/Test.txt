Test Naming:
 > Only use test names potentially valid for identifiers
   (Rationale: Automatically named tests are named with the respective method name)

Text Output:
 > If according 'Content' is active in 'Settings > Gui > Text Output',
   'Standard (incl. Debug)|Error|Trace|Log' output is written to the 'Text Output' window.
   (i.e. Console|Debug|Trace.Write...() all work)
 > To output test relevant tracing information, Trace.Write...() shall be used.
