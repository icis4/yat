
NUnit 2.6.4
-----------

Location
 > Framework assemblies are located at "<WORKSPACE>\NUnit\framework" instead of absolutely referring
   to the installation directory "C:\<Program Files>\NUnit <Version>\bin\framework" because this...
    ...ensures that the assemblies required for linking are always available.
    ...ensures that the desired explict assembly version is used, instead of automatic resolution.
    ...prevents that <HintPath> is set to the installation directory by Visual Studio.
    ...is an easy to understand and obvious approach.
 > Implication of this approach:
    > Assemblies need to be updated when updating the tool version.

Settings

YAT test suite
--------------

Three-tier based settings environment as described in 'MKY.Configuration.Provider'

Categories
 > Add all N/A categories to the 'Selected Categories'
 > Tick 'Exclude these categories'


YAT.nunit
---------

Attention, all potentially referenced assemblies must be listed in the NUnit config file.
Otherwise, the NUnit application domain will not load all required assemblies and runtime
loading of them by .NET will fail.

Drawback: The NUnit GUI is spoilt with all non-test assemblies.

NUnit 3.x
---------

Visual Studio > Tools > NuGet > For Solution...
 > Install
    > NUnit for 'NUnit' and all '...Test' projects

Visual Studio > Tools > Extensions and Updates...
 > Install
    > NUnit Templates
    > NUnit 3 Test Adapter
        + Integrates into Visual Studio > Test
        + Test Explorer can group the tests to Class / Duration / Outcome / Traits / Project
       -- Test Explorer displays the tests in a linear sequence only, no tree view
