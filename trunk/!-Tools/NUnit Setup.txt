Location
 > Framework assemblies are located at "<WORKSPACE>\NUnit\framework" instead of absolutely referring
   to the installation directory "C:\<Program Files>\NUnit <Version>\bin\framework" because this...
    ...ensures that the assemblies required for linking are always available.
    ...ensures that the desired explict assembly version is used, instead of automatic resolution.
    ...prevents that <HintPath> is set to the installation directory by Visual Studio.
    ...is an easy to understand and obvious approach.
 > Implication of this approach:
    > Assemblies need to be updated when updating the tool version.
