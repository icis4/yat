
MKY.IO.Usb
==========

This USB library is based on three existing libraries available on the internet:
- "GenericHid" from <http://www.lvr.com/hidpage.htm>
- "UsbLibrary" from <http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/USB_HID.aspx?msg=2816038>
- "UsbHid"     from <http://www.florian-leitner.de/index.php/category/usb-hid-library/>

The approach of merging these libraries into MKY.IO.Usb was choosen due to:
- None of the libraries provided all the features required for USB Ser/HID for YAT
- Need for a compact though complete library for USB Ser/HID for YAT

An alternative would have been to make use of a Win32 port of "libusb". Such approach is shown
in "libusb.NET". "libusb.NET" uses the "Winbows Backend" port of "libusb". "libusb.NET" is based
on SharpUSBLib by Mike Krüger.

However, experience has shown that a "libusb" based approach isn't feasible:
- The API of "libusb" isn't a good match for a C#.NET based project
- "libusb" doesn't easily fit into a managed .NET solution
- "libusb" is implemented platform dependent and must be separately built for Win32/x86 and Win64/x64
- "libusb" only provides the basic USB functions but no HID specifics
- "libusb Windows Backend" doesn't yet support detection of hot plug-in/out
- "libusb-win32" seems to have serious portability issues on Vista, Win7, x64
- "libusb-win32" is based on libusb-0.1.12 but libusb-1.0 has been available since 2008-12

In the end, it proved much more promising to go for a slim MKY.IO.Usb focusing on USB Ser/HID.
