/*
 * poll() and pipe() Windows compatibility layer for libusb 1.0
 *
 * The way this layer works is by using OVERLAPPED with async I/O transfers, as
 * OVERLAPPED have an associated event which is flagged for I/O completion.
 * 
 * For USB pollable async I/O, you would typically:
 * - obtain a Windows HANDLE to a file or device that has been opened in
 *   OVERLAPPED mode
 * - call usbi_create_fd with this handle to obtain a custom fd.
 *   Note that if you need simultaneous R/W access, you need to call create_fd
 *   twice, once in _O_RDONLY and once in _O_WRONLY mode to obtain 2 separate
 *   pollable fds
 * - leave the core functions call the poll routine and flag POLLIN/POLLOUT
 * 
 * For pipe pollable synchronous I/O (read end polling only), you would:
 * - create an anonymous pipe with usbi_pipe to obtain 2 fds (r & w)
 * - use usbi_write / usbi_read to write to either end of the pipe
 * - use poll to check for data to read
 * Note that the usbi_read/usbi_write function actually perform 
 * asynchronous I/O internally, and could potentially be modified to support
 * O_NON_BLOCK
 *
 * The way the polling on usbi_read works is by splitting all read I/O
 * into a dual 1 byte/n-1 bytes asynchronous read operation.
 * The 1 byte data (called the marker), is always armed for asynchronous
 * readout, so that as soon as data becomes available, an OVERLAPPED event
 * will be flagged, which poll can report.
 * Then during the usbi_read routine itself, this 1 byte marker is copied
 * to the buffer, along with the rest of the data.
 *
 * Note that, since most I/O is buffered, being notified when only the first
 * byte of data is available is unlikely to delay read operations, since the
 * rest of the data should be available in system buffers by the time read
 * is called.
 *
 * Also note that if you don't use usbi_read to read inbound data, but
 * use the OVERLAPPED directly (which is what we do in the USB async I/O 
 * functions), the marker is not used at all.
