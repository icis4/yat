
Initially, the YAT application source tree was the rootfolder of the project. With \YATTools and
then \YATInfra the application source tree got moved a level deeper to \YAT.

There's lot of pros and cons regarding to overall structure. However, for the moment, it's been
decieded to keep \YAT the main folder (incl. docu, tools,...) and the auxiliary folder minimal.
This setup also resembles what is typically done on GitHub, where the (personal) main pages hold
one or more projects.
