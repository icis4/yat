Simply extract the binaries to a temporary location and run "YAT.exe".
Either, extract the binaries to a temporary location and run "YAT.exe", or replace the files in "C:\Program Files\YAT".

See preliminary release notes for the list of changes since YAT <x.y.z>.

Let me know whether your use cases are covered now or whether something is missing or not working as expected.
Any other finding or feedback to YAT is also highly appreciated.

YAT <x.y.z> is expected <<soon|within a month or two|... >>, depending on <preliminary|beta> feedback.

Hmm

Hmm, is not hearing anything the way it should be? For having a tool for free? Getting feedback is the only pay a developer of an open source project like YAT gets. Getting none is the opposite...
