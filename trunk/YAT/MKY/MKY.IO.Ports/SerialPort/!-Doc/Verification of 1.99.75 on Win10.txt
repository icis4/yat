Conclusion for YAT
==================
 +  Microsoft driver is properly handled
 +  Thesycon driver is properly handled
+++ ToriLogic driver is properly handled even though it didn't with 1.99.70 => "EventRunnerLoopShutdown via Reflection" patch works


Conclusion for driver
=====================
Microsoft driver  -
Thesycon driver   +
ToriLogic driver +/- (OK only if "EventRunnerLoopShutdown via Reflection" patch is applied)
