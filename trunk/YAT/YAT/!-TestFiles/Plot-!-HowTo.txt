1. Open OpenOffice Calc or Microsoft Excel or something equivalent
2. Fill in the following values and formula:
    A1: 0
    B1: =SIN((A1/360)*2*PI())
    C1: =43831+(A1/86400)
    D1: =ROUND       || =RUNDEN(B1*360; 2)
    E1: =ROUND       || =RUNDEN(B1*360; 0)
    F1: =IF          || =WENN(B1>=0; 100; -100)
    G1: =CHAR        || =ZEICHEN(65+(ABS(E1)/15))
    H1: =CONCATENATE || =VERKETTEN("A"; G1; "Z")
3. Format:
    A (whole row): Date/Time, e.g....
    ...Excel: JJJJ-MM-TT"T"hh:mm:ss (ISO8601 format)
4. Extend:
    A2: =A1+1
    B1:H1 copy and paste to B2:H2
5. Complete short series by selecting A2:H2 and drag down to row 361
6. Complete long series by selecting A361:F361 and then...
    ...Calc: [Ctrl+Shift+End], [Ctrl+D]
    ...Excel: [Ctrl+C], [Ctrl+Shift+ArrowDown], [Ctrl+V]
7. Export short series by selecting then copy-pasting to a text editor
    Save D1 through D361 to Plot-1-Double.txt
    Save E1 through E361 to Plot-2-Integer.txt
    Save H1 through H361 to Plot-3-String.txt
    Save D1:H1 through D361:H361 to Plot-4-Combined.txt
    Save C1:H1 through C361:H361 to Plot-5-CombinedTime.txt
8. Export long series by exporting as tab separated .txt
    Copy E:F to a new file (values only)
    Save file to Plot-6-IntegersEnormous.txt
    Open file in text editor and remove trailing empty line
