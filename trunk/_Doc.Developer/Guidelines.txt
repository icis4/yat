
override and new
----------------

Write
public override <Name>
but
new public <Name>
to emphasize the intended hiding of a method.


Preprocessor statements
-----------------------

Use
#if (FALSE)
to permanently disable blocks of code.
FALSE is never defined in C#, #if (FALSE) clearly states that block isn't in use.

Write
#if (FALSE)
<Block>
#endif
at column 0 to keep code structure clear of disabled block.

Use
		#if (!DEBUG)
			try
			{
		#endif
to enable or disable blocks of code depending on configuration switches.
Write preprocessor statements one level out of normal code structure to clearly show that these
statements do not belong to the normal code. Still, don't use
#if (!DEBUG)
			try
			{
#endif
because it adds agitation to the code structure.
