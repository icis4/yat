
MKY.IO.Serial.Socket
====================

This socket library implements the MKY.IO.Serial.IIOProvider interface for:
 > TCP/IP Client
 > TCP/IP Server
 > TCP/IP AutoSocket
 > UDP/IP Socket


ALAZ
----
From 2007 until 2012, this library was based on ALAZ:
 > An Asynchronous Socket Server and Client, by Andre Azevedo
 > http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/14155/An-Asynchronous-Socket-Server-and-Client

However, I found some issues which I fed back to Andre by email. But based on the fact that my
feedback was not responded, and a response of Andre to an online question of mine on 2012-05-31,
no update can be expected of ALAZ anymore. Therefore, on 2012-10-11, I have decided to exchange
ALAZ by SuperSocket, as suggested by Andre himself.

Other socket libraries have been looked at as well, but not proven good enough:
 > dotnetasyncsocket,a "TCP/IP socket networking library for .NET"
   > http://code.google.com/p/dotnetasyncsocket/
   > Looks fairly handish, and not like an active project
 > Extasys, an "Asynchronous TCP/UDP socket library"
   > http://code.google.com/p/extasys/
   > Looks more mature, but the API does not provide any events, well...
 > SocketAsyncServerAndClient, "C# SocketAsyncEventArgs High Performance Socket Code"
   > http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/83102/C-SocketAsyncEventArgs-High-Performance-Socket-Cod
   > Looks quite mature and powerful, but architecture as well as implementation doesn't look
     that convincing

Until SuperSocket has proven stable and suitable for YAT, ALAZ will still be part of the YAT SVN
respository.
