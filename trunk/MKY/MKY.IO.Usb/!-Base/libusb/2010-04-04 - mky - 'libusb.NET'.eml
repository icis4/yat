Dear libusb implementers,

I created a .NET adaption layer for 'libusb' which I called 
'libusb.NET'. The layer is in alpha state, rather clean implemented but 
not fully operating yet. Is there a good spot on libusb.org to place 
'libusb.NET'? Probably others are interested in such library and could 
further develop it.

How did I start with 'libusb.NET'? For another SourceForge hosted 
project I was searching the web for an USB HID implementation. Of course 
I came across 'libusb' and 'windows_backend' and evaluted whether I 
could make use of it.
The project I am working on is called 'YAT- Yet Another Terminal' and 
features a terminal to operate and debug serial communications. 'YAT' 
supports RS-232/422/423/485 as well as TCP-Client/Server/AutoSocket, 
UDP. Currently I am adding support for USB Ser/HID. You can find 'YAT' 
on http://sourceforge.net/projects/y-a-terminal/.
'YAT' is implemented in C#.NET. Therefore, I searched for a .NET 
adaption layer for 'libusb' and found 'SharpUSBLib' by Mike Krüger on 
http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SharpUSBLib/default.aspx. 
Unfortunately that project seems no more active and doesn't provide all 
the features I needed for 'YAT'. Therefore, I created 'libusb.NET' which 
is based on 'SharpUSBLib' but uses the March revision of 'windows_backend'.

In parallel to this 'libusb' based approach I tried a pure C#.NET based 
approch and created a MKY.IO.Usb library based on two other libraries. 
Comparing the two approaches has shown that the second approach is much 
more promising for what I require for 'YAT':
- The API of 'libusb' isn't a good match for a C#.NET based project
- 'libusb' doesn't easily fit into a managed .NET solution
- 'libusb' is implemented platform dependent and must be separately 
built for Win32/x86 and Win64/x64
- 'libusb' only provides the basic USB functions but no HID specifics
- 'libusb windows_backend' doesn't yet support detection of hot plug-in/out
- 'libusb-win32' seems to have serious portability issues on Vista, 
Win7, x64
- 'libusb-win32' is based on libusb-0.1.12 but libusb-1.0 has been 
available since 2008-12
See 
https://y-a-terminal.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/y-a-terminal/trunk/MKY.IO.Usb/_Doc/MKY.IO.Usb.txt 
for more details.

Still, 'libusb' provides a much broader support for any kind of USB 
operation, not only Ser/HID like MKY.IO.Usb. Therefore I suggest to put 
'libusb.NET' onto libusb.org and make it available to others. In case 
you have no interest in doing so I will create a separate project on 
SourceForge.

Best regards,
Matthias
