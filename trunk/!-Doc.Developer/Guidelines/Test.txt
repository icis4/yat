Test Naming:
 > Only use test names potentially valid for identifiers
   (Rationale: Automatically named tests are named with the respective method name)

Text Output:
 > If according 'Content' is active in 'Settings > Gui > Text Output',
   'Standard (incl. Debug)|Error|Trace|Log' output is written to the 'Text Output' window.
   (i.e. Console|Debug|Trace.Write...() all work)
 > To output test relevant tracing information, Trace.Write...() shall be used.

Test Configuration:
 > If a test is optional and may be excluded, apply the corresponding category attribute.
 > If a test is mandatory and has infrastructure requirements, it shall not be excludable.
   Instead, add a runtime assertion to the test, e.g.

			if (!ConfigurationProvider.Configuration.PortAIsAvailable)
				Assert.Ignore("'PortA' is not available, therefore this test is excluded. Ensure that 'PortA' is properly configured and available if passing this test is required.");
				//// Using Ignore() instead of Inconclusive() to get a yellow bar, not just a yellow question mark.
