
YAT uses two separate setup projects for x86 and x64. See 'ProjectSetup.txt' for details.

Both projects are configured according to the following steps, changes have to be applied to both.
Keeping both projects in-sync based on text of .vdproj isn't feasible (tried 2015-04-03).

The current installer infrastructure has some issues:
 > Warning "The value of the 'PublicKey' attribute in '.NET Framework 3.5 SP1' does not match that of file...
    => Use of .NET 4.0 or higher is required.
 > Resource editor does not properly generate resources for x64 configuration
    => Use of .NET 4.0 or higher is required.

First warning is currently ignored.
Second issue is worked-around by deploying 'AnyCPU' builds in case of x64.

This all is described in #229 "Upgrade to .NET 4.0 or higher". This is a follow-up to:
 > #191 "YAT should be installed in x64 program folder in case of AnyCPU build"
 > #175 "Add additional solution platforms"

Not yet upgrading to .NET 4.0 because Win7 by default only has .NET 3.5 installed. Wait for upgrade to .NET 4.0 for a few more years.


Setup project configuration
---------------------------

1. Create two new VSI projects
2. Create two additional project configurations "Setup" and "Setup with Prerequisites"
3. Create two according solution configurations and configure them for 'AnyCPU' as well as x86 and x64
4. Build the solution for...
   ...x86      => x86 installer
   ...'AnyCPU' => x64 installer (see #229 "Upgrade to .NET 4.0 or higher" for rationale)
5. Set x86 and x64 as 'TargetPlatform'
6. Configure the project
    > Outputs:
       > Setup.x86\YAT-x86.msi
       > Setup.x86 with Prerequisites\YAT-x86.msi
       > Setup.x64\YAT-x64.msi
       > Setup.x64 with Prerequisites\YAT-x64.msi
    > Optimization:
       > Setup = Speed
       > Setup with Prerequisites = Size
    > Prerequisites:
       > .NET 3.5 SP1
       > Windows Installer 4.5
7. Configure 'File System'
    > Application Folder
       > [Program...Folder][Manufacturer]\[ProductName] => [Program...Folder]\[ProductName]
       > Add primary output of "YAT" and "YATConsole"
          > Release x86 => x86
          > Release 'AnyCPU' => x64
       > Add additional file "YAT Release Notes"
       > Add folders "DejaVu Info" and "Installer"
       > Add Installer banner
       > Add DejaVu info files
    > Replace 'User's Desktop' by 'Fonts Folder'
       > Add DejaVu fonts
    > User's Programs Menu
       > Add new shortcut
          > Name = "YAT"
          > Target = Primary output
          > Icon = Primary output #1
          > Description = YAT - Yet Another Terminal
8. Configure 'File Types'
    > Name =        "YAT Terminal Settings"     "YAT User Settings"     "YAT Workspace Settings"
    > Description = "YAT Terminal Settings"     "YAT User Settings"     "YAT Workspace Settings"
    > Command =     Primary output              <DITO>                  <DITO>
    > Extensions =  yat                         yau                     yaw
    > Icon =        Primary output #2           #3                      #4
9. Configure 'User Interface'
    > Banner = Banner.bmp for all dialogs
