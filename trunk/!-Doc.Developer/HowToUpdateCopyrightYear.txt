
1.	Open Visual Studio (without opening the solution).

2.	Search for the following strings (match case and whole word) throughout...
	*.vdproj
	...and update year:
	 > "Copyright © 2003-2018 Matthias Kläy."  =>   4 replacements

(The above step is required because the .vdproj files cannot be edited while the solution is open.)

3.	Open the solution.

4.	Batch clean the solution in order to...
	...speed up search/replace.
	...speed up verification throughout "\Trunk\*.*".

5.	Search for the following strings (match case and whole word) throughout...
	*.sln;*csproj;*.vcproj;*.ps1;*.bat;*.cmd;*.txt;*.cs;*.resx;*.resw;*.wsdl;*.xaml;*.xml;*.xsl;*.xslt;*.xsd;*.dtd;*.htm;*.html;*.css
	...and update year:
	 > "Copyright © 2003-2018 Matthias Kläy."  => 427 replacements
	 > "Copyright © 2007-2018 Matthias Kläy."  => 147 replacements
	 > "Copyright © 2010-2018 Matthias Kläy."  =>  60 replacements
	 > "2018, Matthias Kläy"                   =>   2 replacements

6.	Then, verify throughout "\Trunk\*.*" (neither match case and nor whole word) and there...
	...should be no more hits except within SVN, archives and other explainable locations:
	 > "2017 " (<= incl. space!), where year = 2017 is the 'old' year
	 > "201[^8] " (<= incl. space!) using RegEx, where year = 2018 is already the 'new' year

7.	Finally, commit all changes, verifying that SVN properties of all files are up-to-date.

(Note that this procedure "schlägt drei weitere Fliegen auf einen Streich":
 > Detection whether all intended files are included in the solution.
 > Detection whether SVN properties of all files are up-to-date.
 > Detection whether filter above is complete.)
