
Takes approx. 20 minutes, plus changes in procedure.

1.	Open Visual Studio (without opening the solution).
	(This step is required because the .vdproj files cannot be edited while the solution is open.)

2.	Search/replace "\Trunk" for the following expressions (match case and whole word) throughout...
	*.vdproj
	...and update year:
	 > "Copyright © 2003-2020 Matthias Kläy." => 4 replacements

3.	Open the solution.

4.	Batch clean the solution in order to...
	...speed up search/replace.
	...speed up verification throughout "\Trunk\*.*".

5.	Search/replace solution (includes this file) for the following expressions (match case and whole word) throughout...
	*.*
	...and update year:                 (approx. counts for feasibility check)
	 > "Copyright © 2003-2020 Matthias Kläy."  => ~481 replacements
	 > "Copyright © 2007-2020 Matthias Kläy."  => ~147 replacements
	 > "Copyright © 2010-2020 Matthias Kläy."  =>  ~69 replacements
	 > "Copyright © 2008-2020 Mettler-Toledo." => ~291 replacements (=> scripting, testing)
	 > "Copyright © 2014-2020 Mettler-Toledo." =>   ~6 replacements (=> scripting templates)
	 > "Copyright © 2017-2020 Mettler-Toledo." => ~265 replacements (=> scripting examples, NUnit testing)
	 > " and 2003-2020 Matthias Kläy."         =>    2 replacements
	 > "2020, Matthias Kläy"                   =>    2 replacements

6.	Then, search/replace "\Trunk" (neither match case and nor whole word) throughout...
	*.*
	...and verify that the following expressions are no more found...
	...except within SVN, 3rd party, archives and other explainable locations:
	 > "2020 " (<= incl. space!), where year = 2020 is the 'old' year
	 > "201\d " (<= incl. space!) using RegEx
	 > "202[^1] " (<= incl. space!) using RegEx, where year = 2021 is already the 'new' year

7.	Next, commit all changes, verifying that SVN properties of all files are up-to-date.

(Note that this procedure "schlägt drei weitere Fliegen auf einen Streich":
 > Detection whether all intended files are included in the solution.
 > Detection whether there are superfluous files in "\Trunk".
 > Detection whether SVN properties of all files are up-to-date.)

8.	Then, search/replace "<OFFLINE>\Releases and Checkpoints\Template" for the following expressions (match case and whole word) throughout...
	*.*
	 > "Copyright © 2003-2020 Matthias Kläy." => 6 replacements

Finally, consider to also check for trailing whitespace according to HowToRemoveTrailingWhitespace.txt.
