
Design Criteria
---------------
 > Generally usable assemblies (i.e. those without any YAT specifics) shall clearly be separated from YAT specific assemblies.
 > Namespace structure shall follow .NET namespace structure.
 > Placing .NET extensions into a YAT.dll is not feasible, as it will be confused with YAT.exe.
 > Placing .NET extensions into a YAT.SystemEx.dll would be inconsistent if namespace was YAT.IO....
 > I/O extensions shall be usable stand-alone per technology, e.g. only serial COM ports, or only USB Ser/HID.
   Rationale: MKY.IO.Usb is tighly coupled to HID.dll thus tighly coupled to Win32!

Possible naming of MKY
----------------------
 > Following ALAZ : YAT.SystemEx.IOEx.PortsEx => sorry, 3 x Ex just makes thing more complicated than necessary
 > Improved ALAZ  : YAT.SystemEx.IO.Ports
                    - or -
                    MKY.SystemEx.IO.Ports

However:
 > MKY.Win32 must not be SystemEx!
 > MKY.IO.Usb must not be SystemEx!
 > MKY.IO.Serial must not be SystemEx!

As a result, there would by MKY.SystemEx... as well as MKY... assemblies. Not really better...

=> Leaving structure as is, i.e. MKY|YAT
