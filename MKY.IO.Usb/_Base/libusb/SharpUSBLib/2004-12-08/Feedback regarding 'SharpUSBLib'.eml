Hi Mike,

I started to create a .NET adaption layer for 'libusb' which I called 
'libusb.NET' based on your 'SharpUSBLib'. I did so for a SourceForge 
hosted project where I needed a USB HID implementation.
The project I am working on is called 'YAT- Yet Another Terminal' and 
features a terminal to operate and debug serial communications. 'YAT' 
supports RS-232/422/423/485 as well as TCP-Client/Server/AutoSocket, 
UDP. Currently I am adding support for USB Ser/HID. You can find 'YAT' 
on http://sourceforge.net/projects/y-a-terminal/.
'YAT' is implemented in C#.NET. Therefore, I searched the web for a .NET 
adaption layer for 'libusb' and found your 'SharpUSBLib'. Unfortunately 
your project seems no more active and doesn't provide all the features I 
needed for 'YAT'. Therefore, I created 'libusb.NET' which is based on 
'SharpUSBLib' but uses the March revision of 'windows_backend'.
After a while I ran into some serious issues and contacted the 'libusb' 
guys. They mentioned 'LibUsbDotNet' on 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/libusbdotnet/. Do you know about that 
project? Looks very well implemented and promising but unfortunately 
doesn't provide Ser/HID yet.
In the meantime I have created a 'MKY.IO.Usb' library that directly 
makes use of the Win32 "hid.dll" and implemented Ser/HID. Being aware 
that this approach isn't platform independent. But it is straight 
forward and it already partly works.

Anyway, I have collected some feedback regarding 'SharpUSBLib'. Just in 
case you still care about that project:

 > Created a Visual Studio 2008 project
 > Internal\NativeCode.cs Line #473
     #if WIN32 doesn't work by default with Visual Studio
     WIN32 is a suboptimal identifier anyway since lines #474/475 also 
apply to Win64/x64
 > BusCollection.cs
     Not necessary anymore, use List<Bus> instead
 > DescriptorCollection.cs
     Not necessary anymore, use List<Bus> instead

In case you don't consider to keep on working on 'SharpUSBLib' anymore, 
I suggest you place a remark onto your site saying that people should 
make use 'LibUsbDotNet' instead. And if you like you can also reference 
my Ser/HID implementation in 'MKY.IO.Usb' in the 'YAT' SVN repository 
under 
https://y-a-terminal.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/y-a-terminal/trunk/MKY.IO.Usb.

Best regards,
Matthias
