1.	1. Connect a USB CDC device						OK														OK													OK

Conclusion for YAT
==================
 +  Microsoft driver is properly handled
 +  Thesycon driver is properly handled
+/- ToriLogic driver is handled but often results in unhandled exception which requires an application restart


Conclusion for driver
=====================
Microsoft driver  -
Thesycon driver   +
ToriLogic driver +/-
