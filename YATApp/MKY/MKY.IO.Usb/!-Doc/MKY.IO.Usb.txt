
MKY.IO.Usb
==========

This USB library consists of the following main parts:
 > DeviceCollection          => Collection that enumerates USB devices
 > Device                    => Encapsulates basic USB functionality such as VID/PID/Manufacturer/Product/Serial/Connect/Disconnect
 > HidDeviceCollection       => Collection that enumerates USB HID devices
 > HidDevice                 => Inherits from Device and adds HID specific functionality such as HID reports
 > SerialHidDeviceCollection => Collection that enumerates USB Ser/HID devices
 > SerialHidDevice           => Read/Write from/to a serial stream (see "SerHID Profile Description.txt" for details)


Architecture
------------

In order to use MKY.IO.Usb, the following assemblies are required:
 > MKY                       => Basic utilities and USB specific utilities in MKY.Utilities.Usb
 > MKY.Win32                 => Wrappers for Win32 API functions and types (system32/kernel32/user32/setupapi/hid)
 > MKY.IO.Usb                => This USB library itself

In addition, there are the following supporting projects:
 > MKY.Test                  => NUnit based test environment for MKY
 > MKY.Win32.Test            => NUnit based test environment for MKY.Win32
 > MKY.IO.Usb.Test           => NUnit based test environment for MKY.IO.Usb
 > MKY.IO.Usb.Demo           => Demo client showing the basic use of MKY.IO.Usb

Optionally, a higher level generic I/O interface is available:
 > MKY.IO.Serial             => Generic I/O interface for various kinds of serial communications
 > MKY.IO.Serial.Usb         => USB Ser/HID implementation of the generic I/O interface
 > MKY.IO.Serial.Usb.Test    => NUnit based test environment for MKY.IO.Serial.Usb


Base
----

MKY.IO.Usb is based on three existing libraries available on the web:
 > 'GenericHid' from <http://www.lvr.com/hidpage.htm>
 > 'UsbLibrary' from <http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/USB_HID.aspx?msg=2816038>
 > 'UsbHid'     from <http://www.florian-leitner.de/index.php/category/usb-hid-library/>

The approach of merging these libraries into MKY.IO.Usb was chosen due to:
 > None of the libraries provided all the features required for USB Ser/HID for YAT
 > Need for a compact though complete library for USB Ser/HID for YAT

An alternative would have been to make use of a Windows/.NET port of 'libusb'. Such approach is shown in 'libusb.NET'/'libusb.NET.Test' in SVN revision 276. 'libusb.NET' uses the 'winbows_backend' port of 'libusb'. 'libusb.NET' is based on 'SharpUSBLib' by Mike Krüger.

However, experience has shown that this 'libusb' based approach isn't feasible:
 > The API of 'libusb' isn't a good match for a C#.NET based project
 > 'libusb' doesn't easily fit into a managed .NET solution
 > 'libusb' is implemented platform dependent and must be separately built for Win32/x86 and Win64/x64
 > 'libusb' only provides the basic USB functions but no HID specifics
 > 'libusb windows_backend' doesn't yet support detection of hot plug-in/out
 > 'libusb-win32' seems to have serious portability issues on Vista, Win7, x64
 > 'libusb-win32' is based on libusb-0.1.12 but libusb-1.0 has been available since 2008-12

Way more promising is 'LibUsbDotNet' by Travis Robinson on <https://sourceforge.net/projects/libusbdotnet/>. 'LibUsbDotNet' is implemented very clean and features a very complete set of USB functionality. 'LibUsbDotNet' supports 'libusb windows_backend' as well as 'libusb-win32' and 'WinUSB' (also see below). 'LibUsbDotNet' is platform independent, rather big and seems to contain no Ser/HID specifics either.

In the end, for YAT, it proved much more straight-forward to go for a lightweight MKY.IO.Usb focusing on Ser/HID.


hid.dll vs winusb.dll
---------------------

Windows provides different dll's that deal with USB:
 > hid.dll    => Rather old infrastructure that provides basic USB functionality
 > winusb.dll => New infrastructure, available in Vista and above

At first, WinUSB looks more promising than HID. Especially because HID only provides limited functions
to control the low-level operations such as SetDescriptor() or GetDescriptor(). However, the WinUSB API
is only useful with devices that provide a WinUSB based driver. See
http://download.microsoft.com/download/9/C/5/9C5B2167-8017-4BAE-9FDE-D599BAC8184A/WinUsb_HowTo.docx
for details.

Currently, MKY.IO.Usb only supports true HID devices, i.e. devices that are handled by HID.


Implementation Details
----------------------

 > Read/Write is done via 'FileStream'
 > File handle is created via 'CreateFile()' (kernel32.dll) providing an HID device path retrieved via the Windows device management infrastructure (setupapi.dll, user32.dll)

This implementation has been challenged by [FR#186  HID data transfer](https://sourceforge.net/p/y-a-terminal/feature-requests/186/)
that requests using 'HidD_SetOutputReport()' instead of the file.
