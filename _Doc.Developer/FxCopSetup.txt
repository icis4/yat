
In-Code Suppressions
--------------------

If really needed, suppress rules in-code using the following attribute:
[SuppressMessage(<FxCop :: Message :: Copy As :: SuppressMessage :: Paste>)]

Such suppressions only work when CODE_ANALYSIS is defined as a conditional compilation symbol in each project, for all build configurations.
